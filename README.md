## Junior developer specializing in data analysis.

My interest in data analysis was sparked by a favorite professor while I worked towards my B.A. in Political Science.<br>
No surprise, a lot of my interests touch on issues of politics and public policy, specifically, the role both have in our daily lives.<br><br>

I believe that data plays an important role in telling complex, human stories. A well crafted narrative can shape the world.<br>
Well analyzed data can enhance a narrative, and a thorough narrative can make cold, calculating data real.<br><br>

I'm a new programmer, mostly self-taught, with experience on both front- and back-end projects.<br>
The back end is my happy place, but I keep building new skills and practicing old ones too.<br><br>
